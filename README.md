## FAQ

**Can I deploy to static hosts?** Yes! Fully optimized for Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, and Cloudflare Pages.

**Why does the music player show an alert?** Some school networks block audio APIs on static sites. We recommend running the music player through the Ultraviolet proxy for the best experience.

**Is EdulearnOS safe for school?** Yes. It is designed as a learning hub and unblocking tool in school environments.
